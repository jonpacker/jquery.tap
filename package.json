  "description": "jquery.tap is a tap listener for jquery. Rather than waiting for the slow `click` listener to trigger on touch devices, it listens to touch events and triggers immediately after the touch finishes. The click event usually takes a few hundred milliseconds after this before triggering, which is a noticable delay.",
